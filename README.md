Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [StarUML](https://staruml.io). Lets AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Codex) drive StarUML programmatically — generate UML diagrams from Mermaid, build native models and diagrams element by element, execute any built-in command, save projects, and more.

## How it fits together

```
  AI Agent  ──MCP──►  staruml-mcp (this package)  ──HTTP──►  StarUML
                                                  :58321 (built-in, 4 tools)
                                                  :58322 (extension 0.3.x, 29 tools
                                                          generated from its manifest)
```

| Package | What it is | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| **`staruml-mcp`** (this repo) | MCP server for AI agents | your machine via `npx -y staruml-mcp` |
| **[`staruml-mcp-extension`](https://github.com/ezrabrilliant/staruml-mcp-extension)** 0.3.x | StarUML plugin adding 29 HTTP endpoints and a manifest of them (`POST /introspect`) | inside StarUML (install once via Extension Manager) |

- Using only Mermaid-based diagram tools? Install `staruml-mcp` only. The 4 built-in tools work.
- Want the full 33 tools (project save/open, element CRUD, relationships, attributes and operations, any StarUML command)? Install **both**.

## Prerequisites

- **StarUML v7.0.0+** with API Server enabled (see below)
- **Node.js 20+** on the machine running the AI agent
- **(Optional)** [`staruml-mcp-extension`](https://github.com/ezrabrilliant/staruml-mcp-extension) 0.3.x installed in StarUML — required for 29 of the 33 tools

### Enable StarUML API Server

Edit `settings.json` at:
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\StarUML\settings.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/StarUML/settings.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/StarUML/settings.json`

Add or update:
```json
{
  "apiServer": true,
  "apiServerPort": 58321
}
```

Restart StarUML.

Verify:
```bash
curl http://localhost:58321/
# → "Hello from StarUML API Server!"
```

## Install & Use

### Claude Code (recommended — HTTP transport)

Start the server in a terminal:
```bash
npx -y staruml-mcp --transport http
# listens on http://localhost:58323/mcp by default
```

Register with Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http staruml http://localhost:58323/mcp
```

> **Port `58323`** is the canonical HTTP port, chosen to sit alongside StarUML's built-in API (`58321`) and `staruml-mcp-extension` (`58322`). Override with `--port <n>` if needed.

Restart Claude Code. Ask:
> "What StarUML tools do you have?"

### Claude Desktop (stdio transport)

Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) or `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "staruml": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "staruml-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop.

### Cursor / VS Code Copilot / Codex CLI

Point your MCP client at `npx -y staruml-mcp` (stdio) or `http://localhost:58323/mcp` (HTTP).

## CLI

```
staruml-mcp [options]

  -t, --transport <type>   stdio | http              (default: stdio)
  -p, --port <number>      HTTP listen port          (default: 58323)
      --api-port <number>  StarUML built-in API port (default: 58321)
      --ext-port <number>  staruml-mcp-extension port(default: 58322)
      --api-host <url>     StarUML API host prefix   (default: http://localhost)
  -V, --version            Print version
  -h, --help               Show help
```

## Tools Exposed

### Built-in (always available, port 58321)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_diagram` | Generate a UML diagram from Mermaid code. |
| `get_all_diagrams_info` | List all diagrams in the current project (id, name, type). |
| `get_current_diagram_info` | Get metadata of the currently focused diagram. |
| `get_diagram_image_by_id` | Export a diagram as PNG by its ID. |


### Extension tools (require [`staruml-mcp-extension`](https://github.com/ezrabrilliant/staruml-mcp-extension) 0.3.x, port 58322)

These tools are not written by hand. The extension publishes a manifest from `POST /introspect`:
each endpoint's name, description, read-only and destructive flags, and JSON Schemas for request
and response. On start the server reads it and registers one tool per endpoint:

- **name** is the path without `/` (`/find_elements` → `find_elements`);
- **description** is the endpoint description cut to the sentences that fit in 100 characters,
  on one line;
- **input schema** is the endpoint's request schema converted with zod's `fromJSONSchema` and
  listed back by the MCP SDK unchanged, except that the projection parameters (`summary`,
  `fields`, `depth`) and the shared `properties` description are shortened, and tools that write
  accept the projection without listing it (the instructions explain it once);
- **annotations**: `readOnlyHint` from the manifest's `readOnly`, `destructiveHint` from
  `destructive` (stated for every writing tool, since MCP defaults it to true),
  `openWorldHint: false`.

A copy of the 0.3.0 manifest is bundled (`src/extension-manifest.json`), so `tools/list` is
complete while StarUML is closed; calls then fail with `EXTENSION_UNREACHABLE` and an install hint.
`npm run sync:manifest` refreshes the copy from a running extension (`-- --url <base>`) or from a
recorded `/introspect` response (`-- --from <file>`).

With extension 0.3.0:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `get_all_commands` / `execute_command` | List command ids / run any StarUML command. |
| `get_project_info` / `new_project` / `open_project` / `save_project` / `save_project_as` | Project lifecycle. |
| `get_element_by_id` / `find_elements` | Read elements; `find_elements` pages with `limit`/`cursor`. |
| `create_element` / `update_element` / `delete_element` | Model elements without views; `update_element` sets, adds, removes, reorders or relocates. |
| `create_element_with_view` / `create_edge_with_view` / `create_relationship` | Elements and relationships drawn on a diagram; `create_relationship` also sets association ends. |
| `add_attribute` / `add_operation` / `add_parameter` / `add_enumeration_literal` / `add_template_parameter` / `add_slot` / `add_tag` | Features of classifiers and instances. |
| `set_stereotype` / `set_documentation` | Common element properties. |
| `create_diagram` / `switch_diagram` / `close_diagram` | Diagrams. |
| `introspect` / `debug` | Versions, factory ids, metamodel, toolbox and manifest / the raw `app` surface. |

To enable extension tools: install `staruml-mcp-extension` in StarUML (Tools → Extension Manager → Install From URL → `https://github.com/ezrabrilliant/staruml-mcp-extension`).

### Results

Tool results are minified JSON. Properties that are `null`, `[]` or `{}` are dropped from every
object, top-level properties that repeat an argument (such as the `filename` passed to
`save_project`) are dropped, and a call with nothing left to report returns `ok`. A missing
property therefore means null or empty. `get_current_diagram_info` returns `null` when no diagram
is active.

Elements come back as the extension's summaries, `{_id, _type, name, _parent}`; references and
owned elements are `{$ref: id}`. Every tool that returns elements accepts `fields` (attribute
names), `summary: false` (every saved attribute) and `depth` (levels of owned elements to expand),
and `find_elements` pages with `limit` and `cursor` (`nextCursor` is absent on the last page). The
`/create_*_with_view` and `/create_relationship` tools return `{view, model}`.

### Resources

Clients that support MCP resources can read these instead of calling the matching tool, which keeps
diagram PNGs out of tool results:

| URI | Content | Tool equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `staruml://diagrams` | `application/json` list of diagrams | `get_all_diagrams_info` |
| `staruml://project` | `application/json` project info (needs the extension) | `get_project_info` |
| `staruml://project/tree` | `application/json` ownership tree of every model element and diagram, `[{_id, _type, name, children}]`, built from paged `find_elements` summaries (needs the extension) | `find_elements` with `type: "Model"` |
| `staruml://diagram/{id}.png` | `image/png` blob; `{id}` is percent-encoded, since ids can contain `/`, `+` and `=` | `get_diagram_image_by_id` |

`resources/list` enumerates one `staruml://diagram/{id}.png` per diagram; when StarUML is not
reachable it lists only the three static resources. A failed read is a JSON-RPC error whose `data`
holds the same `error` object a failed tool call returns.

StarUML 7.1.1's `/get_diagram_image_by_id` ignores every field except `diagramId` (`scale`,
`maxWidth`, `width` and `format` return identical bytes; the live suite checks this), so the
image tool and resource offer no size options.

### Errors

A failed tool call returns `isError: true` with a one-line cause, a hint where one helps, and
`structuredContent.error = { code, message, endpoint, upstream, status?, hint? }`. The message is the
`error` field of StarUML's or the extension's JSON body, so the calling agent sees the real cause
(for example `Element not found: …`) instead of `HTTP 400 Bad Request`.

| `code` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `STARUML_UNREACHABLE` | Nothing answers on the built-in API port: StarUML is closed or `apiServer` is off. |
| `EXTENSION_UNREACHABLE` | StarUML answers but the extension port does not: the extension is not installed or listens elsewhere. |
| `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` | HTTP 404 for the endpoint: the installed StarUML or extension version does not provide it. |
| `REQUEST_REJECTED` | HTTP 4xx or `success: false` without a `code`: the arguments were rejected; read `message`. |
| `UPSTREAM_ERROR` | HTTP 5xx without a `code` from StarUML or the extension. |
| `INVALID_RESPONSE` | The port answered with something other than the `{ success, data, error }` envelope. |
| extension 0.3.0 codes | Passed through with their HTTP status: `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (400), `UNKNOWN_TYPE` (400), `NOT_FOUND` (404), `UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT` (404, with the upgrade hint), `NO_PROJECT` (409), `STARUML_ERROR` (422, StarUML refused the operation), `INTERNAL` (500). |

Arguments are checked against the tool's schema before any request, so a wrong-typed field fails
with an MCP input validation error and the extension never sees it.

## Example Prompts

- *"Create an ER diagram in StarUML for a POS database: users, menus, transactions with relationships."*
- *"Generate a sequence diagram for JWT login: frontend → /api/auth/login → AuthService → DB → JWT response."*
- *"Show me the current diagram in StarUML."*
- *"Export diagram with ID `xyz123` as an image."*

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezrabrilliant/staruml-mcp.git
cd staruml-mcp
npm install            # also installs the pre-commit hook (lint-staged: eslint + prettier)
npm run dev            # tsx watch on src/
npm run build          # bundle to dist/
npm test               # vitest: unit, tool-level and HTTP transport tests
npm run test:coverage  # same, failing below 100% lines/branches/functions/statements
npm run test:live      # STARUML_LIVE=1: every tool against a running StarUML + extension
npm run load-test      # HTTP transport load test (needs npm run build)
npm run benchmark:tokens # token cost of three scenarios, current vs. 56864ca
npm run sync:manifest  # refresh src/extension-manifest.json from a running extension
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit for src and tests
```

Tool-level tests drive each tool through the MCP SDK's in-memory transport against local
`http.Server` stubs of ports 58321 and 58322; the generated tools are tested one per manifest
endpoint, including that each listed input schema round-trips the manifest's JSON Schema. The live suite saves the open project to a temp
file, works in a fresh project, and reopens the original file when done; unsaved changes of the
original are kept only in that temp copy, whose path it prints.

## Performance

`scripts/load-test.mjs` starts `dist/index.js` with `--transport http` and sends
`tools/call get_all_diagrams_info` at each concurrency level, with StarUML replaced by an
in-process stub so the numbers measure this server. Every request builds a fresh `McpServer`
(stateless mode), which dominates the cost. Any failed request makes the script exit non-zero;
`--max-p99-ms` and `--min-rps` add budgets, and CI runs it with
`--requests 2000 --max-p99-ms 2000 --min-rps 100`.

Measured on an Intel i9-9980HK (8 cores / 16 threads), macOS, Node 22.23.3, 5000 requests per
level after 500 warm-up requests, load generator on the same machine, with the 33 tools of the
bundled 0.3.0 manifest registered per request (stub runs pass `--ext-port 1` so a local StarUML does
not change what is measured). Ranges span three runs on a machine shared with other work:

| Concurrency | req/s | p50 | p99 | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 940–1024 | 44–49 ms | 84–93 ms | 0 |
| 200 | 957–1169 | 160–178 ms | 283–482 ms | 0 |

Against the real StarUML 7.1.1 API with extension 0.3.0 (`--live --requests 1000 --concurrency 50`,
two runs): 813–817 req/s, p50 60–61 ms, p99 74–76 ms, 0 errors. The generated tools' zod schemas
are built once per manifest and shared by every per-request server.

## Token efficiency

`scripts/token-benchmark.mjs` (`npm run benchmark:tokens`) replays three modelling scenarios
through the MCP in-memory transport against the test stand-ins for ports 58321/58322, so it runs
offline. Upstream responses are shaped like StarUML 7.1.1 + extension v0.2.2 output (the command
list is the 322 ids captured from 7.1.1 in `scripts/benchmark-data/`). The baseline is the server of
commit `56864ca` (before issue #5), loaded with `git show`. Each scenario counts the tool
definitions a client forwards to the model (name, description, input schema) plus server
instructions once, and the text of every result; image bytes are excluded because they are the
same on both sides and billed as vision input. Tokenizer: `o200k_base` from `gpt-tokenizer`.

| Scenario | Calls | Results before → after | Total before → after | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mermaid class diagram + preview | 4 | 186 → 120 | 3290 → 2050 | 37.7% |
| Native use-case diagram | 11 | 595 → 349 | 3699 → 2279 | 38.4% |
| Inspect and refactor a class model | 8 | 5184 → 3377 | 8288 → 5307 | 36.0% |
| All scenarios | 23 | 5965 → 3846 | 15277 → 9636 | 36.9% |

Tool definitions and instructions went from 3104 to 1930 tokens (37.8% less). They are counted
once per scenario; clients resend them every turn, so the real saving grows with conversation
length. 315 of the remaining 1930 tokens are the `$schema` URL the MCP SDK adds to every input
schema.

The issue's 60% target needs work on the extension side: projection (`fields`/`depth`/`summary`),
pagination (`limit`/`cursor`), `/batch` and `build_diagram` would shrink the dominant costs, which
are the 322-id command list and full element dumps from `find_elements`.
